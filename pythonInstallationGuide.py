Steps to install Python 3.8.0 in Redhat Linux 8.

Do not uninstall any in build Python Packages on your kernel. This may damage some of your system properties.

You can use the interpreter python3 for your script executions.

sudo yum install python38*
python3 --version
pip3 --version

Note: This is not a script yet. Its just an information document, do not mis guide yourself by seeing .py at the end of the file name.

Thankyou.
